###FULLSCREEN 

![14](project_images/hands.png)

An Android app framework for turning any android device into a piece of Art.  The codebase is specifically designed to render an HTML Site, Video, or GIF and takeover the functionality of the home button.  The app also disallows the user to close or exit the app.  When paired with a Samsung Galaxy Gear Smart Watch the device becomes a wearable piece of Art.

FULLSCREEN was developed for Aram Bartholl's FULLSCREEN Group show at XPO Gallery

Using the exported GIFs from HANDS and The Android App framework from FULLSCREEN I created two Android apps currently on the Play Store.  

[Android Home App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hand.fullscreen.home)

[Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hand.fullscreen)



A Gallery exhibition of this work would involve a capture booth, a projection area, an exhibition area show selected captures on Android Tablets and Smart Watches.  These devices would no longer function as smart devices but exsits purely as peices of Art.
