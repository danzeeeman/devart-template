###FULLSCREEN 
is an Android app framework for turning any Android device into a piece of Art.  The codebase is specifically designed to takeover the functionality of the home button and disallow the user to close or exit the app.  When paired with a Samsung Galaxy Gear (gen 1) the device becomes a wearable piece of Art.

Using the exported GIFs from HANDS and the code base of FULLSCREEN I created two Android apps currently on the Play Store.
